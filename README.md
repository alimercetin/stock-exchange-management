# **STOCK EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION**

Stock Exchange Management Application provide endpoints to manage Stocks and Stock Exchanges. H2, in memory database, is used for storing data. ingredients. Jakarta validations and annotations are used for validation. Errors are caught at the controller level by controller advice.

Security part is not implemented. For simplest solution, we can use PreAuthorize annotation with a custom security logic provided by Spring Security. If we will run this application on kubernetes environment, we can utilize service mesh to define network rules. If we aim for security as platform, we can use Keycloak or similar solutions as Identity Access Management tool and on a gateway like NGINX we can filter the incoming request with an infrastructure checking authorization and authentication with JWT token based solution.
